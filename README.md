# NodeAngularApp
sample node and angular applicaiton


This is a simple angular app that uses node as a server side rendering

To run the app, you must have bower and node installed on your machine.

Run the below commands in the applications root directory 

    npm install
    bower install
    gulp    
    node app.js
    
    now just open any browser and navigate to this url:  localhost:3000 


PS: There is no directive for the table row, for now its direcly on the users page. 
The edit page of the user only saves the modified first name and last name on the browse, it doesn't make any post request yet, which can be modified later.
